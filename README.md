# SNA_ethereum_network
Our project for Social Network Analysis. We are analysing public Ethereum data to see how the network evolved over the past years, finding some major players: miners, exchanges, contracts, and even scams. 

# Data
We couldn't upload all the data, since it is huge. However, the graphs we have used in the final version are the updated intersection graphs under the "graphs" directory.
